I am a senior undergraduate student from the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn), [School of Physics](http://english.phy.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn).

My research mainly focuses on black hole perturbation theory and its various applications, including waveform modeling of different gravitational wave events (e.g. BBH, EMRI, b-EMRI), quasi-normal modes of black holes, and scattering of gravitational wave by black holes.

You can find my 200 pages bachelor's thesis (in Chinese) here: [Gravitational radiation of b-EMRI systems](../Bachelor_Thesis_YuchengYin.pdf)
