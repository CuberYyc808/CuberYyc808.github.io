## Journal Articles

- **Yucheng Yin**, Josh Mathews, Alvin, J. K. Chua, and Xian Chen, [Relativistic model of binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral systems and their gravitational radiation](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.103007) *Phys. Rev. D 111 (2025) 103007*


## Theses

- Bachelor's Thesis (in Chinese): [双星-极端质量比旋进的引力辐射](../Bachelor_Thesis_YuchengYin.pdf) (Gravitational radiation of b-EMRI systems)<br>
  Chapter 2 and 3 of this thesis are the **First** detialed reviews of black hole perturbation theory and EMRI waveform modeling written **in Chinese**. I hope it can provide a tutorial for beginners. Chapter 4 and 5 are about our work on b-EMRI waveform [Phys. Rev. D 111. 103007](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.103007). Chapter 6 is what I'm currently working on.
